title: AvatarPoseNode.OnCommonUpdate
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In this OnCommonUpdate, the transform information of the paired AvatarObjectSlot (if any), is gathered and transformed to the [[Local space]] of the slot where the AvatarPoseNode is attached

What this means is that after we equip an avatar (which pairs the AvatarObjectSlot and the AvatarPoseNode of corresponding [[BodyNode]]s), we can succesfully //puppeteer// the avatar by the position of our AvatarObjectSlot's driving the avatar's AvatarPoseNode's transform!
