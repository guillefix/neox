title: AvatarManager.Equip
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This function "equips" an avatar to an user.

What this mainly implies is that the [[AvatarObjectSlot]]s in the user root hierarchy (set up by [[CommonAvatarBuilder.BuildDevices]]) are matched (via two nested for loops) to the [[AvatarPoseNode]]s in the avatar.
